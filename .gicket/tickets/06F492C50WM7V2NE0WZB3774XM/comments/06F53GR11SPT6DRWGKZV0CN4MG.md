Open questions / Risiken
- Non-additive changes to `DataVaultDiagnosticsResult.ReadShape` or the public `DataVaultReadShapeDiagnostics` family will break the public API snapshot and existing consumers.
- PIT and provider-neutral fallback can be materially multi-step; flattening them into one synthetic stage narrative will misrepresent the visible request shape.
- Provider caveats must stay derived from read-strategy status, fallback causes, provider-behavior profile, and translated metadata; otherwise diagnostics will over-promise optimizer behavior.
- Support-bundle export is redaction-sensitive; leaking raw parent hash keys, raw as-of values, or SQL text through new performance fields would violate the current export contract.
- Split recommendation: No split recommended; the current source-backed API baseline supports one additive ticket on the existing `ReadShape` surface.

Next steps
- Role 'po-critic' can pick up the ticket via policy-matched status/labels.
- Validate implementation scope against updated acceptance criteria.
