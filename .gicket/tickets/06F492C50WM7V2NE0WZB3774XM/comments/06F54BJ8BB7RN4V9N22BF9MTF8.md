Open questions / Risiken
- Blocking finding: Persisted delivery contract infers an existing public API/type without visible source evidence in the current branch snapshot.
- Blocking finding: Unsupported inferred API claim: Leaving :: - Leaving this ticket open as a development story risks duplicate work against API, docs, and tests that already exist in the repository.
- Required PO action: Replace inferred existing-API/type claims with source-backed evidence from the current branch, or restate the contract so the missing type/API may be created explicitly.
- Risky assumption: Existing API/type assumption lacks source evidence: Leaving :: - Leaving this ticket open as a development story risks duplicate work against API, docs, and tests that already exist in the repository.
