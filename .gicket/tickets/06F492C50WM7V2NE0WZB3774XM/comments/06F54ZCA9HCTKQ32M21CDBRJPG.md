Open questions / Risiken
- If implementation changes the current request-bound diagnostics payload shape or redaction behavior instead of adding bounded new facts, existing consumers may break.
- If projection role names vary by provider or request path, explicit and registry-backed diagnostics become harder to compare; keep role names deterministic and provider-neutral.
- If implementation creates a parallel read-diagnostics carrier instead of extending the source surface already used by current tests, consumers may see duplicate or inconsistent contracts.
- Split recommendation: No split is required after removing the unsupported type assumptions; the ticket remains one bounded additive diagnostics refinement.

Next steps
- Role 'po-critic' can pick up the ticket via policy-matched status/labels.
- Validate implementation scope against updated acceptance criteria.
