[gicket-bot] Run report (outcome: dev-workflow-failed)

Summary
- Developer workflow failed while executing test command `bash tools/check-format.sh`.

Changes applied
- Lease label `bot/lease:hp-ai-<redacted>.2` was applied to ticket `06EXB74NRVRX18GD33CH1C12SW`.
- Optimistic claim succeeded (`expectedRevision=06EXSA40FQFARCNSQXW5441K7R`, `currentRevision=06EXSF2W1028W1EDFJANNDRWW4`).
- Dispatch ownership was assigned to instance `hp-ai-<redacted>.2`.
- Prepared interactive developer scratch worktree for target branch 'ticket/06EXB74NRVRX18GD33CH1C12SW-story-model-data-vault-building-blocks' from source 'ticket/06EXB74NRVRX18GD33CH1C12SW-story-model-data-vault-building-blocks'.
- Triggered developer repair attempt 1/3 after isolated workspace test failure.
- Triggered developer repair attempt 2/3 after isolated workspace test failure.
- Triggered developer repair attempt 3/3 after isolated workspace test failure.
- Stopped automatic developer repair loop after 3 repair attempt(s).
- Planned implementation step: Reproduced the reported formatter failure on the three prior implementation artifacts.
- Planned implementation step: Added missing final LF terminators to the Data Vault metadata source file, the unit test project file, and the DataVault metadata unit test file without changing code behavior.
- Planned implementation step: Verified the resulting diff is limited to removing the no-newline-at-EOF markers on those files.
- Planned implementation step: Reran formatting and bounded build/test diagnostics from the repository root.
- 9 additional item(s) omitted. See the local context artifact for full run details.

Open questions / Risiken
- Risk: `dotnet test --nologo` could not complete in this sandbox because Microsoft.Testing.Platform/MSBuild named-pipe IPC was denied under `/tmp`; this is the known environment limitation noted in the ticket contract.
- Risk: Default `dotnet build ...` without `-m:1` also hit MSBuild node IPC behavior in this local shell, while the same builds succeeded with `-m:1`.
- Command `bash tools/check-format.sh` failed with exit code 1: format violation: src/DCoding.Data.DVault/Modeling/DataVaultMetadata.cs: must end with a final newline
- stderr[1]: format violation: tests/DCoding.Data.DVault.Tests/Unit/DCoding.Data.DVault.Tests.Unit.csproj: must end with a final newline
- stderr[2]: format violation: tests/DCoding.Data.DVault.Tests/Unit/DataVaultMetadataTests.cs: must end with a final newline

Next steps
- Re-run the failing command in the relevant branch workspace: `bash tools/check-format.sh`.
- Inspect stdout/stderr output in bot logs and local shell.
