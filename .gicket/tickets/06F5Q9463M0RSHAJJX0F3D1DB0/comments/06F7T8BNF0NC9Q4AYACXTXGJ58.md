Open questions / Risiken
- Blocking finding: Persisted delivery contract infers an existing public API/type without visible source evidence in the current branch snapshot.
- Blocking finding: Unsupported inferred API claim: Do :: - Do not assume or require any pre-existing public tracing API or public ActivitySource accessor.
- Required PO action: Replace inferred existing-API/type claims with source-backed evidence from the current branch, or restate the contract so the missing type/API may be created explicitly.
- Risky assumption: Existing API/type assumption lacks source evidence: Do :: - Do not assume or require any pre-existing public tracing API or public ActivitySource accessor.

Next steps
- Resolve blocking findings and required Product Owner actions before implementation continues.
- Re-run PO-critic after clarification updates are applied.
