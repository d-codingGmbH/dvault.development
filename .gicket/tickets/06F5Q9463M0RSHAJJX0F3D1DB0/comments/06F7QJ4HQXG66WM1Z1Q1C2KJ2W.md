Summary
- PO-critic review completed with a blocking assessment for ticket '06F5Q9463M0RSHAJJX0F3D1DB0'.

Changes applied

- Optimistic claim succeeded (`expectedRevision=06F7QG1C5CJ6WCW1JG9ZBH5B5W`, `currentRevision=06F7QGACR54KJS4ZB9M00A9FS0`).
- Dispatch ownership was assigned to instance `hp-ai-<redacted>.1`.
- Prepared interactive po-critic scratch worktree for target branch 'ticket/06F5Q9463M0RSHAJJX0F3D1DB0-story-add-activity-tracing-for-save-and-read-ope' from source 'f14c81e6a999cd579692ef1e2128daf12e146013'.
- Removed bot-owned orchestration details from the persisted PO-critic assessment.

- Updated ticket fields (labels: added [blocked/dev, blocked/test, needs-po, automation/bot-ready]; removed [automation/bot-ready, critic-needed]).
- Published runtime write-group comment template 'handover-po'.
- Committed transactional ticket writeback for TP `TP8` on branch `ticket/06F5Q9463M0RSHAJJX0F3D1DB0-story-add-activity-tracing-for-save-and-read-ope` as `a1c30cfb5da2`.

Open questions / Risiken
- Blocking finding: Persisted delivery contract infers an existing public API/type without visible source evidence in the current branch snapshot.
- Blocking finding: Unsupported inferred API claim: Tests, Unit, Snapshots, PublicApi :: - Public API snapshot coverage already exists under tests/DCoding.Data.DVault.Tests/Unit/Snapshots/PublicApi; prefer an internal holder unless repository API policy explicitly requires a pub...
- Required PO action: Replace inferred existing-API/type claims with source-backed evidence from the current branch, or restate the contract so the missing type/API may be created explicitly.
- Risky assumption: Existing API/type assumption lacks source evidence: Tests, Unit, Snapshots, PublicApi :: - Public API snapshot coverage already exists under tests/DCoding.Data.DVault.Tests/Unit/Snapshots/PublicApi; prefer an internal holder unless repository API policy expli...

Next steps
- Resolve blocking findings and required Product Owner actions before implementation continues.
- Re-run PO-critic after clarification updates are applied.
