Open questions / Risiken
- Required PO action: Re-run PO refinement or handback only after the ticket-field state matches the contract's stated steady-state label baseline.
- Split recommendation: No additional split is needed for the parent epic once the label contradiction is fixed; the four existing child stories already bound the delivery path.
- Split recommendation: Create separate follow-up tickets or epics for any future first-class Postgres runtime support, SaveChanges interception, or deferred Data Vault capabilities.

Next steps
- Resolve blocking findings and required Product Owner actions before implementation continues.
- Re-run PO-critic after clarification updates are applied.
